## The Big Ones

The following is a summary of the main features added to darktable
4.4. Most of these features are described more fully in the user manual.

- Allows for multiple presets to be defined and applied automatically
  on matching images. Each preset after the first one will create a
  new module instance just on top of the current module (so it applies
  after).

  To better view which module instance corresponds to which preset the
  module label is set to the preset name. This preset name will be
  changed if some parameters on the module are changed (and so does
  not correspond to the preset anymore). If the module label is hand
  edited it will be kept.

- Rework the module default parameters and make them usable
  in copy/paste, presets and styles.

  Many modules have default parameters based on image metadata or
  current workflow:

  - Exposure: use a specific default in scene referred workflow,
  - Denoise profile: is camera and ISO specific,
  - Lens correction: is camera and lens specific,
  - Base curve: is camera sensor specific,
  - White balance: is metadata specific,
  - Orientation: is metadata specific,
  - Color calibration: is metadata specific.

  For all those modules it is now possible to paste parameters and
  ensure that proper default metadata based will be used. This is
  achieved by selecting the "Reset" corresponding column in the
  preset and style dialog.

  For presets a new option can be selected in the dialog for the
  preset to be using the module's default parameters on which it is
  applied. The option is named "Reset all module parameters to their
  default values"

  This new generic feature has permitted to clean-up some hacks to try
  to do the same kind support at the module levels and which was
  anyway limited.

- Rework the workflow setting, we now have the choice between:

  - Scene-refrerred (Filmic)
  - Scene-referred (Sigmoid)
  - Display-referred (Legacy)
  - None

  The chromatic adaptation preference has been removed and is implied
  by the workflow. The Color calibration module is used when in
  Scene-referred and While balance otherwise.

  Finally, using None workflow and the two new features above
  (multiple presets support and reset to default parameters metadata
  based) one can create any other kind of workflow. For example it is
  possible to use Sigmoid with the White balance module.

- Add support for Color Harmony Guide lines in RYB vectorscope.

  There is 9 color harmony guides proposed:
  - Monochromatic
  - Analogous
  - Analogous complementary
  - Complementary
  - Split complementary
  - Dyad
  - Triad
  - Tetrad
  - Square

  Those guides can be used to shift colors of a picture to match one of
  the color harmony. One can see the color harmony guides a bit like
  the composition guides but related to colors and not to composition.

## Other Changes

- Add global <kbd>right-click</kbd> and drad to fix image
  rotation. This can now be used at any moment in darkroom as long as
  the currently focused module is not using this shortcut. This allows
  for fast rotation correction without having to open the Rotation and
  Perspective module.

- Add OpenCL support to the Sigmoid module.

- Do not invalidate snapshot anymore when the history is changed
  (compressed or reset). All snapshot are now stored with their full
  history and can be reconstruct properly.

- Module "Levels" has been deprecated, use "Levels RGB" instead.

- Module "Contrast Brightness Saturation" has been deprecated, use
  "Color Balance RGB" instead.

- Convert the zoom widget on the navigation window to a standard
  drop-down for better fitting the darktable style.

- Lower the ISO 12646 border size still staying in the recommended
  size.

- Rework the preset dialog filter to better show the relation between
  the raw, non-raw and the three formats HDR, monochrome and
  color. This avoids confusions and creating presets that are actually
  not applied.

- The default module group has been removed. It is better to use one
  of the scene-referred group.

- Add support for loading QOI images.

- Redesign the export and thumbnails generation.

  Some hacks have been accumulated to try to have exact size of the
  exported pictures. All this has been redesigned and simplified to have
  a better export size.

- Various code cleanups and improved performances. Some SSE2 code path
  have been removed (as the optimized parallel code generated by the
  compiler is faster) or code optimized in the following modules. This
  leads to a speed gain of 5% to 25%:

  - Dithering
  - Graduated Density
  - Input Color Profile
  - Color Look up Table
  - Borders
  - Surface Blur
  - Vignette
  - Retouch
  - Denoise Profile
  - Invert
  - Local Contrast with Local Laplacian
  - Lowpass
  - RGB Levels
  - Filmic (legacy)
  - Color Balance (legacy)

  - The gaussian generator used by many modules: Censorize, Denoise
    Profile, Lowpass, Diffuse & Sharpen, Defringe, RAW Chromatic
    Aberrations, Base Curve, Perspective Correction, Filmic RGB,
    Retouch, Tone Equalizer and Zone System (deprecated). Meaning all
    those modules have parts now running faster.

  - The box blur filter used by the focus peaking, the guided filter for
    blending, the new highlight recovery algorithms, and the Bloom,
    Highpass, and Soften modules. Meaning all those modules and
    features have parts now running faster.

  - The Edge-Avoiding a-trous Wavelet used by those modules Contrast
    Equalizer and Denoise(Profiled). Meaning those modules have parts
    now running faster.

  - Loader for JPEG2000 file format

- Improve Highlights reconstruction "inpaint opposed" performance by
  providing an OpenCL implementation and using internal caching in
  darkroom.

- Various improvements of the debug interface:

  - -d common outputs most valuable information and should be used for
     bug reports instead of -d all.

  - --bench-module <modulea,moduleb> does runtime benchmarking of the
      specified modules.

  - --dump-pipe <modulea,moduleb> writes in & output data of the
    specified modules as pfm files for inspection.

- Improve support for Lens correction based on embedded data.

  - Add supports for dng files,
  - Allows finetuning of scale,
  - Add an auto-scale button.
  - Improve overall module performance of about 8%.

- Add OpenMP support to XCF export for better performances.

- Add support for writing metadata to XCF format (see notes below).

- Add OpenMP support to the RGBE loader for better performances.

- Added section headers to the sort by drop-down (files, times, etc).

- Shortcuts assigned to presets or styles will be shown when hovering
  over them in their menu.

- Long left clicking a preset will keep the menu open so you can
  quickly switch between several to see the effect without having to
  repeatedly click the preset button to reopen the menu. You can also
  scroll over the preset button to switch to previous/next presets
  (like you already could via shortcuts).

- When the crop module receives focus and switches to an uncropped
  view of the image, the crop areas around the edges of the image
  briefly light up to indicate that they are now draggable.

- The crop module, which shows the full image to facilitate making
  adjustments, will not trigger an unnecessary recalculation until the
  module loses focus (for example by switching to another module or by
  collapsing the crop module itself) at which point the new crop will
  be used to resize. If shortcuts are used to make changes to the crop
  without focusing the module, they will still be implemented
  immediately.

- The height of resizeable widgets and lists can now be changed by
  dragging their bottom. The previous method to achieve this, by
  scrolling while holding the control key, has been changed to
  shift+alt+scroll (and a note has been added to all tooltips
  consistently). This frees up <kbd>ctrl+scroll</kbd> to fine-tune
  changes in RGB Levels or the histogram (to change exposure or black
  level). In the navigator ctrl+scroll will adjust zoom level without
  bounds, like it would do over the central area.

- The histogram gui has been reworked. Control buttons have been
  splitted in two groups: on the left side, a series of buttons to
  switch among histogram modes (histogram, waveform, rbg parade,
  vectorscope). On the right side, the buttons that control the aspect
  of each mode (RGB Channels, Orientation, Vectorscope type). For the
  RYB vectorscope, a series of buttons have been added to visualize
  guide lines for the most common color harmonies.

- The central image internal scroll zoom logic in the darkroom has
  been reworked in order to make the zoom steps more perceptually
  uniform for all the image sizes.

- Better display of the module's instance name in darkroom to have a
  clear visual separation between the module name and the instance
  name. The label name in the history is also updated accordingly.

- Improve display of the range rating widget. It should be more
  readable with a better contrast and a rework of some icons.

- In lighttable, link "hold" and "sticky" preview shortcuts to the
  same action (previously there were two "toggle sticky preview mode"
  actions, one with and one without focus detection). Focus detection
  is selected via an element, hold or toggle via an effect. All mapped
  shortcuts are shown in the tooltip of the preview layout button.

- Read Exif metadata from AVIF, HEIC and JPEG XL images using native
  libraries if Exiv2 does not support it.

- Write Exif data to the eXIf PNG chunk if using Exiv2 version newer
  than 0.27.x. This is the new standard way to store Exif data in PNGs.

- Makes laplacian highlights recovery mode less memory hangry (save
  around 40%) and allow for a large speed up. This makes this recovery
  mode lot more usable and allows for more recovery iterations.

- Add support for embedded DNG lens corrections metadata. By reading
  the rectilinear and vignette_radial metadata it is now possible to
  make lens correction.

- Add support for MaxApertureValue metadata to complement the already
  supported ApertureValue. This is the only metadata tag available in
  Leica M Monochrom, M8, M9 & M10 DNGs.

- Export masks for EXRs as extra channels.

- The search filter has been improved to also search the camera's brand
  and model.

## Bug Fixes

- Remove the commit button from the crop module has it was not used
  anymore.

- Fix the reset of modules with specific default parameters to ensure
  that the modules will be set back in the same state as it was when
  first importing the image. This fix is related with the rework of
  auto apply module default parameters in the section above.

- Properly transform XMP regions from metadata to ensure they match
  the image. The XMP regions may come from the camera face recognition
  for example.

- Fix some rounding issues in the calculation of the borders in the
  border module. This creates borders on opposite sides with the same
  size.

- Code maintenance and bugfixes for writing dng files as used in
  "Create HDR"

- Pixelpipe cache safety and performance improvements. This makes
  better hit when looking in the cache and so allow for better
  performances.

- Fix "--threads n" restricts OMP threads to specified number (does
  not allow for more threads than available on the host.

- Raw chromatic aberration module always works on full image data
  so quality is immune to scaling in darkroom mode.

- A bug with shortcuts (and dt.gui.action) to set the active item in a
  combobox with varying content has been fixed and now it is also
  possible to directly set the values of the combos for the focused
  module's blending mode etc. (by setting the shortcuts effect).

- Fix the update preset entry in the presets menu to allow for it to
  be activated in more situations. For example after entering in the
  darkroom and modifying the some parameters in the module the update
  preset entry was not selectable. It was necessary to first select
  the preset and then changing the parameters.

- Fix the color picker sample area calculation to ensure at least one
  pixel is selected. At large zoom level and with a very small area
  some rounding were sometimes returning an empty area. This leads to
  returning a wrong color sample.

- Fix the ignore EXIF rating on initial import for images containing
  the XMP.xmp.Rating tag. This does not change the rating if an XMP
  with some specific rating has been already made.

- Fix some minor memory leaks in some modules.

- Fix a possible crash when selecting the original module history
  state and compression the history.

- Fix a possible crash in gradient mask creation due to an issue in
  the implemented parallelism.

- Fix crawler when updating the XMP. The XMP file must be set with the
  timestamp of the database entry to ensure we don't have continuous
  mismatches reported.

- Fix different issues on the mask manager. It is now possible for all
  masks kind to be added continuously. Also the brush was not properly
  displayed after being created from the mask manager. A crash when
  creating gradient from the mask manager has been fixed. For all
  shapes the editable state is properly set after being created making
  it possible to move and resize the different parts.

- Fix brush correction tool placement as used in Retouch module, the
  issue was more visible when the image is distorted.

- Fixed CPU vs OpenCL output differences in PPG and VNG/VNG4
  demosaicers, match greens and color smoothing.

- Finalscale now properly uses same user defined scaling mode for
  image and masks.

- Fix display when editing a shapes' name in masks manager. Avoid
  overlay of the old and new name.

- Fix for clean Nikon camera make and model Exif info on import;
  opening in darkroom is no longer required, and now works for non-raw
  files as well.

- Fix Canon CR3 metadata crop not being ignored; full visible sensor
  area (as determined by LibRaw) is always being used now on new
  imports.

## Lua

### Add action support for Lua

- The lua call to dt.gui.action has become more flexible, with most
  parameters optional, so you can read the focused status of a module
  doing just dt.gui.action("iop/filmicrgb", "focus").

- tooltips show these compacter lua commands in mapping mode (only
  adding the last parameter, instance, if the module supports
  multi-instance) and have been added to presets and styles menus as
  well.

- Lua commands can be copied to the clipboard, using ctrl+v in the
  shortcuts dialog, both from a selected action or shortcut, or long
  right click when in mapping mode (over a widget) or in the
  presets/styles menus.

- The shown/copied lua command for a slider or combobox will set the
  value it currently has.

- A shortcut can now be directed to a lua script that mimics a
  standard slider, dropdown or button, but dynamically selects the
  real widget(s) that receive(s) it, based on for example which module
  is focused or enabled. The advantage is that all fallbacks work as
  normal, so you can assign a midi knob to it and turning it (holding
  shift/ctrl to speed up/down) or pressing it to reset work regardless
  of which widget receives it. Basically this is a much more flexible
  alternative to the fake widgets under processing
  modules/<focused>. This allows owners of for example an x-touch mini
  to use their scarce rotors in different, fully configurable, ways
  while working in different modules (which can also be focused using
  midi buttons which will then light up). Such configurations could be
  shared using https://github.com/darktable-org/lua-scripts.

- Support shortcuts to sliders/combos created in lua, either via
  visual mapping mode or in the shortcuts dialog under the lua
  category. Elements and effects are not supported.

### Other Lua changes

- Add image orientation retrieval support.

- Two new properties have been added to get the flags (category,
  private) and the synonyms from a tag.

## Notes

- When exporting to AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, or XCF, selecting specific
  metadata (e.g. geo tag or creator) is not currently possible. For
  AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, and XCF formats, darktable will not include any
  metadata fields unless the user selects all of the checkboxes in the
  export preference options.

- In order to support the correct display of numbers in darktable, the
  minimum supported Gtk version has had to be increased to
  3.24.15. For people who need to build darktable with an older
  version, this can be supported by reverting the following change:
  remove line 241 of darktable.css file on your system. See:
  https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/issues/13166
