## The Big Ones

The following is a summary of the main features added to darktable
4.8. Please see the user manual for more details of the individual
changes (where available).

## Performance Improvements

## Other Changes

- Changed the sort order of tags to a natural and case insensitive order.

- Added Apple Keychain password storage backend for macOS devices.

## Bug Fixes

## Lua

### API Version

- API version is now 9.2.0

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `scripts_installer` to handle user names with spaces on Windows.

### Add action support for Lua


### Other Lua changes

- Allow access to image `change_timestamp`.

## Notes

- When exporting to AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, or XCF, selecting specific
  metadata (e.g. geo-tag or creator) is not currently possible. For
  AVIF, EXR, JPEG XL, and XCF formats, darktable will not include any
  metadata fields unless the user selects all of the checkboxes in the
  export module's preference options.

- In order to support the correct display of numbers in darktable, the
  minimum supported Gtk version has had to be increased to
  3.24.15. For people who need to build darktable with an older
  version, this can be achieved by removing line 241 of the
  `darktable.css` file on your system. See
  https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/issues/13166.

- Starting with release 4.4 a new support policy regarding macOS
  versions has been put in place â€“ darktable releases will now only
  support those macOS versions that are also supported by Apple.
  Release 4.6 therefore drops support for macOS versions older than
  12.5.
