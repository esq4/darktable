$ sha256sum darktable-3.8.0.dmg
??? darktable-3.8.0.dmg
$ sha256sum darktable-3.8.0.exe
??? darktable-3.8.0.exe
```

When updating from the currently stable 3.6.x series, please bear in
mind that your edits will be preserved during this process, but the new
library and configuration will not be usable with 3.6.x any more.

You are strongly advised to take a backup first.

#### Important note: to make sure that darktable can keep on supporting the raw file format for your camera, *please* read [this post](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/raw-samples-wanted/5420?u=lebedevri) on how/what raw samples you can contribute to ensure that we have the *full* raw sample set for your camera under CC0 license!

## The Big Ones

- The keyboard shortcut system has been entirely reworked and extended to allow you
  to control darktable with other devices, for example, MIDI devices
  and game controllers. Standard keyboard/mouse shortcuts can now make use
  of mouse movements (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) as well as multiple
  button/key presses and short or long presses/clicks.

  Please note that any shortcuts you have previously created are not transferred
  to the new functionality and will need to be redefined in darktable 3.8.

- New diffuse and sharpen module.

- New scene-referred blurs module.

- Perspective correction module has been renamed to rotate and perspective
  and now allows you to manually define correction settings by drawing lines
  or rectangles on the image (replicating keystone correction functionality
  from the deprecated crop and rotate module)

- Added support for multiple images in the print view. The page can be
  filled with multiple areas, each of which can be moved around and placed on
  the page with the ability to snap to a grid for precision.

- A new LMMSE demosaic algorithm has been introduced. This algorithm is particularly
  suited to high ISO and/or noisy images.

- The composition guides from the crop module are now available globally and do
  not require the crop module to be activated.

## Other New Features And Changes

- The denoise (profiled) module now uses wavelets mode by default and its default
  settings in Y0U0V0 mode have been improved.

- Flip buttons have been added to the orientation module (functionality moved
  from crop and rotate).

- Background jobs handling has been removed from preferences.

- Much of the SSE-specific code has been removed, since compiler-generated code
  is usually faster.

- The darktable-generate-cache script now displays filenames and image ids.

- File name matches in the collections module are now faster.

- Mask handling is faster.

- Processing module order can now be automatically applied based on the image
  properties.

- Folder status is properly refreshed when a mount is changed.

- An area color picker is selectable by using a <kbd>Right-Click</kbd> in
  addition to the existing <kbd>Ctrl+click</kbd> action.

- Substitution variables have been added for image dimensions as follows:
  $(SENSOR_HEIGHT) and $(SENSOR_WIDTH) for the absolute pixel
  dimensions of the sensor; $(MAX_HEIGHT) and $(MAX_WIDTH) for the raw
  image size; and $(EXPORT_HEIGHT) and $(EXPORT_WIDTH) for the
  post-cropping final image size.

- More work on code speed-up in many different routines ensuring
  better vectorization and/or OpenMP definition. Notably, the
  split-toning, haze removal and soften modules have been improved.

- The beginner preset in module groups now takes the chosen workflow
  (display or scene referred) into account.

- The quick access panel now takes the chosen workflow
  (display or scene referred) into account.

- New sorting options based on capture, import, modification,
  last export and last print times.

- Tooltip for raster mask now includes source module information.

- The following modules have been deprecated:

  - Crop & rotate - the features of this module are now shared between the crop,
    orientation, and rotate and perspective modules.

    Note that the new crop module is now placed after the retouch module
    to ensure that the full image can be used a source area.

- A new option has been added to allow you to choose when to start writing
  changes to the XMP sidecar files. Choose to (a) never write XMP,
  (b) write XMP as soon as the image is imported; or
  (c) write XMP only after the user has edited the image in the darkroom view.

- Timezone entry has been improved in the geotagging module.

- A new preference has been added to choose the number of recent collections to display.

- Rating support has been added to the collections module making possible to create
  presets, for example, to select the best images of 2021.

- PNG files are now supported in the watermark module.

- Minor usability improvements have been made to the tone equalizer,
  ensuring that the cursor is shown on focus and the module is activated on scroll.

- The values in the global color picker module are now selectable.

- HSV has been added as an option in the global color picker module.

- the color scheme of the timeline is improved.

- The scopes module (previously named histogram) can be moved to the
  left panel.

- Improved color rendering for waveform and parade scopes.

- A new vertical waveform scope option has been added.

- Live samples can now be displayed in the vectorscope.

- An RYB option has been added to the vectorscope.

- The lut3d module has been moved after filmic.

- The automatic mask tuning has been improved in the tone equalizer module.

- Tiling has been enabled in the color balance rgb, diffuse and filmic rgb modules
  to allow very large images to be processed.

- When scanning for updated XMP files, the synchronization window has been improved
  to offer more choices as to how the database/XMP files should be updated.

- Added read support for HEIF/HEIC file format.

- Added support for ARM64/Apple M1 as a build target.

- Added a preference to invert the behavior of mouse scroll up/down on drawn
  mask attributes. At the same time, and for consistency, the scroll-up action has been
  set to increase all mask attributes by default.

- Added timestamp in camera import dialog for consistency with other
  import dialog.

- The current module order is now shown in the module order module header to
  save space in the GUI.

- The split toning module now displays the hue in degree for consistency
  with other modules.

- Rejected images in the lighttable view are now dimmed for clarity.

- The last selected Piwigo album is now remembered in the export module.

- New "magic wand" icons are now used for the auto-tune actions in
  the tone equalizer module.

- For advanced users and developers, OpenCL build options are now exposed in
  darktablerc.

- The "module order" entry is now moved to the end of the copy/paste dialog
  for better usability, as this option is rarely used.

- The collections module now offers some new presets based on image time to
  complement the existing presets based on the import time.

- Add a borderless requirement indicator in the print module when the user's
  selected margins are below the hardware margins.

## Bug Fixes

- Multiple memory leaks have been fixed.

- Fixed green equilibration in RCD CPU code path.

- Select the best illuminant for DNG images.

- When trying to enter a view that cannot be used (like the tethering view
  where no camera is attached), make sure to reset the combobox back to
  the previous view.

- Fix calibration optimizations for delta E in Channel Mixer RGB module.

- Fix focus peaking, which was in some cases displaying some wrong
  random pixels on the borders.

- Fix refresh when pasting the whole or part of history.

- Fix possible uninitialized-data access in RCD demosaic.

- Update metadata fields when applying a preset.

- Fix creation of liquify interpolated path to be closer to what the user
  would expect.

- Multiple Windows PATH specific issues have been fixed. Also, UNC
  path-names are now supported.

- Make sure RAW+Jpeg files keep the same filename during copy & import.

- Add some consistency to the drawn shape opacity increase/decrease, which was
  working in the opposite way to the other mask controls.

- Invert liquify strength vector rotation for consistency.

- Make metadata and tagging consistent regarding the current selection.

- Fix some rounding errors in masks with sharp corners, which were creating
  discontinuities in the mask area.

- Fix the image loader flag, which was not properly set at import time.

- Add a search box in preset preferences and shortcuts.

## Notes

- The 3.8.x series of darktable releases will be the last which supports macOS 10.7 and building with Xcode 11.
  The next major release will require at least macOS 10.14 to run and Xcode 12 to build.

## Changed Dependencies

- Move from Lua 5.3 to 5.4.
