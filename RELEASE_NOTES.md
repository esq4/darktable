## The Big Ones

The following is a summary of the main features added to darktable
4.2. These features are described more fully in the user manual and
accompanying blog post.

- New Sigmoid display transform module.

- Two new highlight recovery algorithm are proposed: in-paint opposed
  and segmentation. The in-paint opposed has proved to be very stable
  and good in a lot of pictures so it has been made the default now.

- A full rework of the image display has been done. An initial work
  has been to create an easy to use image display on the central
  area. This routine supports all display mode: focus-peaking and
  color assessment. This routine is now used for the darkroom area,
  for the second window and the duplicates.

  So the second window gets the focus-peaking display and more
  importantly the color assessment mode which is an important feature.

  To achieve that properly a new routine has been created which run a
  separate pixelpipe which is fully equivalent to the darkroom
  one. This gives a properly aligned display.

  Using the new pixelpipe and display routines the snapshot routine
  has been reworked. This new version has fully dynamic snapshots. The
  snapshot can be panned and zoomed and still perfectly aligned with
  the darkroom display which permit a proper comparison.

- Add style preview in lighttable style module and in darkroom style
  widget. The preview is displayed in the tooltip when overing the
  style entries. The tooltip UI has been redesigned at the same time.

- The lens module gains built-in support. Some cameras are recording
  lens correction values into the EXIF. Those data are now retrieved
  and used by the lens module to do the corresponding corrections.

- JPEG XL (read / write)

- Show modules with transition + keep them fully visible when opening
  or expanding.

- Large pixelpipe cache overhaul.

## Other Changes

- Add support for manipulating masks without scrolling (for tablet
  users). The mask manager has been enhanced with a new collapsible
  section containing controls for changing masks properties.

  It is also possible to change a properly shared by a group of mask.

  At the same time the circle and ellipse masks have been enhanced
  with new on-canvas controls to change the size and feather.

- Add WebP read support.

- Embedded ICC profile in exported WebP file.

- A double click on a notebook tab reset all widgets it contains.

- Support regional data/time format in thumbnail tooltips.

- Show lua command in action tooltip.

- Remove SSE code path from White Balance and Color Out modules. The
  optimized code from the compiler gives comparable speed.

- Add support for JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) file extension
  which is a standard JPEG.

- The preference to auto-apply a sharpening has been removed. One can
  add an auto-applied presets in the sharpen module and gain the same
  effect.

- Add support for updating existing pictures in Piwigo export.

- The White Balances presets have been migrated to an external JSON file.

- Remove Color Balance layout and White Balance control background
  color from the preference as this can be done directly on the module
  itself.

- Improve profile support for AVIF & EXR format.

- The current collection image count is now shown in the toolbox. This
  makes this information available even if the top hinter area is
  hidden.

- Try to get color-space for PNG file from the cICP chunk. This was
  added in a recent revision of the PNG spec, so we take advantage of
  it is present.

- The reading of 16-bit half float for TIFF format is now done using
  the Imath library.

- Enable actions on the export format and storage widgets. This means
  that they can be mapped to shortcut.

- Introduce balanced OpenCL vs CPU tiling. This makes it possible to
  use CPU tiling if there is not enough memory on the OpenCL card and
  so would require a lot of tiles to be handled on the card. At the
  end, the large number of tiles plus the overlapping area will make
  the use of the OpenCL code patch slower (or much slower) than
  handling the image without tiling on CPU.

- In preview mode the overlay display block is not shown by
  default. Moving the cursor on the half top of the thumb will display
  it. The block is still hidden automatically after some timeout.

- Set light patterns for Behringer b-control midi rotors
  (BCR2000/BCF2000)

- Fix reading of EXIF metadata when importing EXRs (if desired,
  existing files must be re-imported, refreshing metadata is not an
  option).

- Add support for scrolling through presets with shortcuts.

## Bug Fixes

- Properly use the display color profile in the slideshow. This was
  missing and so images where just ignoring the color profile and were
  displayed (very) differently than on the lighttable or darkroom.

- Properly honor the modules' off status of in a style. Using a style
  in the export module can now be used to disable a module otherwise
  enabled in the history stack.

- Fix bauhaus popup size and position.

- Fix iop-order name on reset.

- Do not display deprecated module actions in preferences' shortcuts section.

- Fix some bauhaus widgets popup positioning on Wayland.

- Fix speed issue when importing large folders with XMP having lot of
  metadata.

- Fix some missing GUI update in the Liquify module. In some cases,
  changing the strength of a node in a curve or line was not properly
  updating the displacement values.

- Fix bad interaction between the color assessment mode and the side
  panels.

- Fix infinity focus display in image information.

- Fix translation of retouch module toast messages.

- When importing we keep the folder or filmroll property if active. If
  another collection mode was selected we use the default filmroll
  one.

- Fix Lab conversion in TIFF import.

- Fix highlights visualization in all recovery mode.

- Fix X-Trans highlight reconstruction visual indicator.

- Fix undo/redo after a style applied via a shortcut.

- Do not rebuilt the whole tree when deleting or editing a
  presets. This gives a better stability to the UI.

- Fix some refresh of the mask manager when changing images.

- Fix mask selection after a continuous mask creation.

- Fix name and tooltip in demosaic preferences to be correct for all
  sensor kind.

- Remove the automatic check for OpenCL headroom as this was causing
  more problems than it solve.

- Fix non blinking cursor in the processing module search dialog. This
  was making the module looks like it was not active.

- Properly record the libraw black level.

- Fix state of some UI buttons in the retouch module when switch images.

- Fix selection of unaltered images.

- Widgets in collapsed section are not disabled anymore making them
  actionable via shortcut.
