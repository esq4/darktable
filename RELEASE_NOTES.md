## The Big Ones

## New Features And Changes

- Many optimizations in different part of the code (soften, tone equalizer,
  circle masks, color picker).

## Bug fixes

## Notes

- The database upgrade can be slow.

  This new version is modifying quite a lot the structure by adding many
  foreign keys and cascade support. This will avoid dangling data in the
  database and will enforce a better consistency.

## Lua

* API changed to 6.2.0

* password storage and retrieval - added _darktable.password.save()_ and _darktable.password.get()_ to save and retrieve passwords using the darktable password storage back end.

* widget naming - widgets now have a name field, making it possible to style them using CSS

* _darktable.gui.libs.visibility_ is fixed so setting a lib to hidden (false) removes it from the user interface.

* preferences - added _darktable.preferences.destroy()_ to remove a preference.  Added _darktable.preferences.get_keys()_ to return a sorted table of all of the preferences for both darktable and lua.

* get image from database by image id - added _darktable.database.get_image()_ to retrieve an image by the image ID

* _darktable.gui.libs.metadata_view.destroy_info()_ - function added to remove field added by _darktable.gui.libs.metadata_view.register_info()_ from the image information display.  Thanks @phweyland

* API change to 6.2.1 - **SCRIPT BREAKING CHANGE**

* event naming - add a name field to _darktable.register_event()_ so that multiple events of the same type can differentiated and the desired one selected and accessed.

* event destruction - _added darktable.destroy_event()_ to remove an event.

* API change to 6.2.2 - **SCRIPT BREAKING CHANGE**

* add _selection-changed_ to the lua events so that scripts can respond when the selection changes

* selection naming - add a name field to _darktable.gui.libs.select.register_selection()_ so that the selection can be selected and manipulated after creation

* selection destruction - add _darktable.gui.libs.select.destroy_selection()_ to remove an selection button from the user interface.

* selection sensitivity - add _darktable.gui.libs.select.set_selection_sensitive()_ to set selection button sensitivity

* API change to 6.2.3 - SCRIPT BREAKING CHANGE

* action naming - add a name field to darktable.gui.libs.image.register_action() so that the action can be selected and manipulated after creation

* action destruction - add darktable.gui.libs.image.destroy_action() to remove a lua created action button from the user interface.

* action sensitivity - add darktable.gui.libs.image.set_action_sensitive() to set action button sensitivity
