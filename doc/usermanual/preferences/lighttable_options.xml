    <bridgehead renderas="sect5">color manage cached thumbnails</bridgehead>

    <para>
      If activated darktable generates thumbnails in a general color space (AdobeRGB) in order to
      render them independently of the individual monitor. Conversion to the monitor color space
      is done at display time. If this option is not activated thumbnails are directly stored in
      the specific monitor color space valid at generation time and are subsequently displayed
      without further corrections (default on).
    </para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect5">don't use embedded preview JPEG but half-size raw</bridgehead>

      This is slower. (default off).

    <bridgehead renderas="sect5">high quality thumb processing from size</bridgehead>

    <para>
      If the thumbnails size is greater than this value, it will be processed using the full
      quality rendering path which is better but slower (default 720p).
    </para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect5">delimiters for sizes categories</bridgehead>

    <para>

      the size of the thumbnail. Set here thumbnails sizes delimiters, separated by "|"
    </para>
    <para>
      For example, "120|400" means 3 categories of thumbnails :
      0px->120px, 120px->400px and >400px
    </para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect5">expand a single lighttable module at a time</bridgehead>

    <para>
      Controls how lighttable panels are expanded. If this option is enabled, expanding a panel by
      <emphasis>clicking</emphasis> collapses any currently expanded panel. If you want to expand
      a panel without collapsing the others you do so with <emphasis>Shift+click</emphasis>.
      Disabling this option reverts the meaning of <emphasis>click</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>Shift+click</emphasis> (default off).
    </para>
